The first section of the notebook determines the correlation between apartments with themselves with a sampling of 10-min then we increase the timestep until the correlation hits a correlation above 0.5. At the same time, we explore the second hypothesis which is that the correlation is higher for the mean value of the three apartments. As before we increase the timestep as long as the threshold is not respected.\n",
