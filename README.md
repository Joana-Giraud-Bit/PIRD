This Github repository is associated with a research project focused on predicting the electrical consumption of domestic hot water using a statistical model. The 'Data' folder contains CSV files with measurements spanning two years, and detailed explanations about the data can be found within that folder.
The 'Code' folder includes the scripts used for the research. Each script is accompanied by a corresponding Jupyter notebook in the 'Jupyter Notebook' folder. These notebooks provide comprehensive explanations for each line of code, highlight the libraries employed, and offer insights into the rationale behind the coding decisions made during the course of the project.

To guide you through my work, I've organized the code in a specific order: 

1- Average Domestic Hot Water (DHW) and electrical analysis per day per Rive De Gier.py associated with the Average_DHW_and_electrical_analysis_per_day_per_Rive_De_Gier.ipynb
1bis- Average Domestic Hot Water (DHW) and electrical analysis per day per Villefontaine.py associated with the Average_DHW_and_electrical_analysis_per_day_per_Villefontaine.ipynb

2-Data_Visualization_For_One_Apartment

3-Correlation analysis between the apartments

4-Correlation analysis of apartment to themselves

There are two versions of the first code, labeled as '1' and '1bis', these versions are essentially identifical but based on different datasets corresponding to different cities. The purpose of having two versions of Code 1 was to study each city and its values independantly, without being influenced by the other.

Code 2 assists us in visualizing the domestic hot water consumption and electrical consumption linked to hot water for a sole apartment.

Code 3 elaborates on our initial hypothesis, aiming to establish correlations between different apartments.

The final Code addresses our second hypothesis, exploring correlations whithin individual apartments.
